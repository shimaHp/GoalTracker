# ðŸŽ¯ GoalTracker

A full-stack goal management system built with Blazor WebAssembly, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core. The app allows users to create, track, and categorize personal goals, each with its own list of nested work items (subtasks), to stay productive and accountable.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

âœ… Clean Architecture (Domain-Driven Design)  
âœ… Layered project structure (API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, UI)  
âœ… Full CRUD for Goals  
âœ… Nested Work Items: Each goal contains multiple subtasks  
âœ… Full CRUD for both Goals and Work Items  
âœ… Goal Categorization  
âœ… Pagination for efficient data loading  
âœ… User Authentication (Register / Login)  
âœ… Authorization Policies (Role-based / Claims)  
âœ… Entity Framework Core with SQL Server  
âœ… Blazor WebAssembly frontend  
âœ… Unit tests for all layers (one per project, expanding soon)

## ðŸŒŸ Authentication & Security

- Secure user authentication using **ASP.NET Core Identity**  
- **Role-based authorization policies** to restrict access to protected actions/pages  
- API calls use **JWT tokens** for authenticated sessions  


---
## ðŸŒŸ Unit Testing
Basic unit tests included for:
Domain
Application
Infrastructure
API
âœ… Currently: One test per project
- Upcoming: Full coverage after completing unit testing tutorials

---
## ðŸŒŸ Architecture Notes
Uses a one-to-many relationship between Goal and WorkItem
Clean separation of concerns via:
âœ…Domain: Models & interfaces
âœ…Application: Business logic & services
âœ…Infrastructure: Data access (EF Core)
âœ…API: Web endpoints
âœ…Blazor.UI: Frontend UI
Easily extendable to support:
-Status, deadlines, reminders
-User-specific data
-Custom roles and permissions
